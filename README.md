# ðŸ§  Top Vector Databases (2025)

Vector Databases are specialized databases designed to **store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors** generated from embeddings.  
They power applications like **semantic search**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, **recommendation engines**, and **LLM chatbots**.
